# Enhancing Room Occupancy Inference from Sparse PIR Sensor Data Using Transformer Models

This repository contains the code associated with the research paper on estimating room occupancy using various sensor-based methods without relying on ground truth. Currently, it includes only the code related to a public dataset. The repository will be updated with additional contents once the project-specific dataset is released.

## Repository Contents

- `Method comparison.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the analyses and comparisons of different sensor-based methods for estimating room occupancy.
- `src.py`: A Python script providing necessary functions and imports used throughout the notebook.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need to install the necessary Python packages. You can install these packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Dataset
The dataset used in this study can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Follow these steps to set up the dataset:

Download the dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation) Room Occupancy Estimation dataset.
Place the downloaded files into the data directory within this repository.

### Running the Notebook
After installing the dependencies and setting up the dataset, you can run the `Method comparison.ipynb`.
